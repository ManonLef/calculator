## About this project

This project is the final project in the foundations course of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). 
The main goal of this project is to implement the things you've learned along the way regarding html, css, javascript and DOM Manipulation and tie them all together in a functional calculator. 

### The basic requirements to call this project complete were:
- [x] The calculator should not evaluate more than 2 numbers at a time. Example: 2 + 2 * 3 = 12 since it will first calculate 2 + 2. 
- [x] The calculator should have all the basic math operations like add, subtract, multiply and divide.
- [x] The UI should work; the buttons need to respond to user input and the display should track the numbers you input.
- [x] The UI calculator display should not overflow.
- [x] The calculator should not crash when dividing by zero or pressing the equals button before all numbers are assigned.

### Bonus features for extra credits
- [x] The calculator should have a UI that preferably looks nice and shows some of the CSS skills you have gained.
- [x] Add a decimal button for floating point numbers.
- [x] Add a backspace button.
- [x] Add Keyboard Support.

### Extra feautures I added on top of the above for practice and fun
- [x] A power button.
- [x] A plusminus sign to toggle negative numbers.
- [x] Short animations when updating the display.
- [x] Random error messages.
- [x] Double displays for tracking input and `ans` to show you're operating with a previous result.
